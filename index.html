			<p>Great to meet you! My name is <b>B. Sakura Cannestra</b>, and I’m a reporter based in the Bay Area. Right now, I’m a graduate student at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism, focused on web design, writing passionately, and telling interactive stories. I’m also currently interning with the POLITICO California team, focusing how the industry’s ever-innovating status impacts policy decisions in the state and nation.</p>
			<p class="intro">I graduated in 2020 from UC Berkeley with a bachelor’s degree in English, minors in History and Creative Writing. In that time, I also grew my skills at The Daily Californian, covering everything from student government to higher education policy to protests attended by thousands. I also have experience in writing personal essay-style columns and publishing illustrations, also from The Daily Californian.</p>
			<p class="intro">I'm a curious person (some could say nosy) interested in a wide variety of topics, such as video games, modern content creation, internet culture, internet policies, housing policies, tech policies, the inner machinations of our governing bodies, higher education, and student life. </p>
			<p class="intro"> It’s a wide array of interests, but what can I say! I’m also very interested in new mediums of creation. While most of my background is in writing, I’m working on my web development skills and am deeply fascinated by how people have been able to use new platforms, like TikTok or Instagram, for journalism.</p>
			<p class="intro">I'm an aspiring plant dad and an avid bullet journaler, which is basically when you create your own planner to be as detailed as you want. Mine has a lot of calligraphy and to-do lists, and I love gel pens. Thanks for stopping by, and get in touch below!</p>
