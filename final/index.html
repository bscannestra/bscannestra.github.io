<!-- Questions for when I hang out at Soo's OH on Thursday

	1) What is an API?? How do you install an API???
	2) Here is what I have right now. The Javascript's really basic and honestly just ucing what we talked about in class, please don't critique the JS. How does the CSS look?
	3) What should I use to have the image change on scroll, z-index or opacity?  -->

		<section class="leftcontainer container">

									<!-- STEP THREE -->
			<p class="textbox bigspace step">The 13-year-old version of me reveled in success, always doing the best. In high school, I wanted to make everyone proud of me. If you weren’t going to be proud of me, then I at least wanted to impress. I didn’t have to win everything, I didn’t need to be number one, but I had to overachieve at the very least.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">I always worked hard to improve. My grades through high school averaged in the A range. I joined the speech team, aiming for the state championships. In freshman year, I was called up to the varsity water polo team at the end of my junior varsity season. </p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">When I was 13, I was already working against about six knee injuries, which ultimately took me out of sports that occur on land. The amount of pressure that gravity put on my body would make my leg hurt.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">I never liked the idea that my body was physically incapable of certain things.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">I fought against the very real problem of my kneecap not staying in place, as if I could make up for that limitation by just pushing myself a little harder. I didn’t want to confront it.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">In the water, gravity was less of a factor, and I could move with less fear I had to improve as an athlete in the one sport that I could. I still forced myself to study harder, but I put more effort into water polo than into my grades because I needed to prove to myself that I could still be an athlete.</p>

										<!-- STEP FOUR -->
		<section class="container">
			<p class="textbox bigspace step">Water polo is a taxing sport. You tread water the entire time, and the only reprieve is when you get to hang on the wall between quarters or are pulled onto the bench. There are seven people in the pool for either team at any given time — six field players and a goalie.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">To be clear, I did other things in high school, too. But all of my experiences were colored blue by my time on the water polo team, from doing homework on the pool deck at tournaments to putting on makeup before junior prom in the locker room of some high school I’d just played at. </p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">I played the field, set defense and set offense, swimming back and forth across the whole pool every time the ball turned over.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">My team on high school had ten people at its maximum, which left three people on the bench to substitute in and out during the game. I rarely got subbed out.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">By my senior year, I was holding down our team’s defense and was one of our team’s top scorers. </p>

		<div alt="drawing of me at age 17, holding a water polo ball with a cocky grin, though I look tired" class="frozenpicture frozenportrait__right hiding" id="imseventeen" style="background-image: url('./img/midme.png')"></div>

										<!-- STEP FIVE -->
		<section class="leftcontainer container">
			<p class="textbox smallspace step">The 17-year-old version of me was just as much of a tryhard as the 13-year-old version.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">I had been good enough at what I was doing for a while, long enough that things that had been impressive became normal. I’d become a vital part of the varsity water polo team. It wasn’t enough, though. I had to get better. </p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">I was also 17 the last time I dislocated my knee.</p>
		</section>

											<!-- STEP SIX -->
		<section class="container">
			<p class="textbox smallspace step">I had been at water polo practice. We were doing a “dry land” exercise on the astroturf lacrosse field, a workout that involved pivoting between sprints.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">It was a surprise to be out on the turf. I didn’t own cleats, wearing my normal weight room tennis shoes.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">My kneecap didn’t make it through the first pivot. It was twisted by how quick I turned and how firmly I jumped into my sprint.</p>
		</section>

		<div alt="drawing of me on the ground, white outline with a black background, holding my knee and crying" class="frozenpicture frozenportrait__left hiding" id="ground" style=" background-image: url('./img/sadme.png')"></div>

											<!-- STEP SEVEN -->
		<section class="rightcontainer container">
			<p class="textbox bigspace step">For a brief moment, I couldn’t feel anything other than the searing pain. </p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">This was what, the seventh time I’d dislocated my knee? It was familiar.</p>
			<p class="textbox bigspace">I crawled my way to the edge of the field and sat there for the rest of the hour, leg bent up but not enough to be too painful.</p>
		</section>


												<!-- STEP EIGHT -->
		<section class="container">
			<p class="textbox smallspace step">I didn’t want to tell my coach that I couldn’t finish practice. I didn’t want to tell my parents. This wasn’t the first time, what was I supposed to tell them? Sorry Mom, I broke my leg again?</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace"> It felt like it was my fault, even though there’s no way I could have controlled the smoothness of my tennis shoes nor the looseness of the astroturf gravel.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">Once the entire team was done with the exercise, I got up and limped to my car, waving my teammates off with a shaky smile. The pain in my leg was overshadowed by my shame. I was disappointed in myself for injury again. </p>
		</section>

			<div alt="top-down drawing of a car driving forward, headlights on, white outline on black background" class="frozenpicture frozenportrait__center hiding" id="vroom" style="background-image: url('./img/car.png')"></div>

												<!-- STEP NINE -->
		<section class="container">
			<p class="textbox smallspace step">I didn’t want to cause any more trouble than I already would, so I drove myself home.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">If I could just ice my knee to get the swelling down, then go to practice the next day, it would be fine. I'd get over it. I could still play.</p>

												<!-- STEP 10 -->
			<p class="textbox bigspace step">My parents were far from faulting me. It was kind of a shock when I got home. </p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">Mom was in the kitchen while I limped in from the garage and announced that I’d dislocated my knee at practice. </p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">I hadn’t even actually announced it. She asked why I was home early. I just didn’t want to out and say it, I think. Couldn’t get the words past my teeth.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">It didn’t occur to me that me needing help wasn’t an inconvenience, and that the only person who was disappointed was myself.</p>

		<div alt="drawing of me at age 23, both hands behind my back, wearing a button down shirt and slacks. I look even more tired." class="frozenpicture frozenportrait__left hiding" id="imtwentythree" style="background-image: url('./img/oldme.png')"></div>

													<!-- STEP ELEVEN -->
		<section class="rightcontainer container">
			<p class="textbox bigspace step">I’m 23 now. I haven’t broken my leg since.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">The other day, I turned down an invitation to play with the graduate school’s intramural soccer team. I still love team sports, but I can’t risk hurting my leg again.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">It wasn’t an easy call, but it was for the better. I’m still trying my best. I think everyone is, really. But doing my best best doesn’t always involve me being the best, and being alone. </p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">I still have trouble asking for help when I need it, admitting that I need help, but at least now I have that mental debate with myself. ‘Is this something I should ask someone about?’ is not a thought I would’ve had when I was 17, let alone 13.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">It’s a small step, but it’s something worth being proud of. Right?</p>
		</section>

												<!-- STEP TWELVE -->
		<section class="container">
			<p class="textbox bigspace step">While reflecting on these instances and worrying about not wanting to break my leg, I thought back to the 17-year-old version of myself.</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace"> I say I’m trying my best, but how far is trying my best from trying to be better?</p>
			<p class="textbox smallspace">If I broke my leg again, tomorrow even, would I drive myself home again?</p>
			<p class="textbox bigspace">Disappointingly, I think the answer is still yes.</p>
			<p class="textbox bigspace">I guess I’ll have to try harder to let it go. </p>
