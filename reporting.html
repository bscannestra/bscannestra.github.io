			<h2>Published by San José Spotlight || July 6, 2025</h2>
			<p class="intro">I have been following Sunnyvale's "Village Center" plans, which was originally meant to encourage aging retail spaces to redevelop into mixed-use, walkable neighborhoods, with retail on the bottom and housing on the top. The proposed developments cut retail altogether, threatening to turn under resourced North Sunnyvale neighborhoods into food deserts. </p>

			<h2>Published by San José Spotlight || May 19, 2025</h2>
			<p class="intro">A source told me about a company that was filing PRA requests across dozens of Bay Area cities, seeking constituent emails during the COVID-19 pandemic. I found some of these requests, including one which detailed the company's plans to train a large language model (LLM) using the messages. In this story, I detailed those requests, the company's plans, and the ethical quandries with using public data to train AI.</p>
