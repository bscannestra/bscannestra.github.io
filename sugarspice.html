                <p class="subhead">Sugar</p>

                <p>You have to go out and buy more all-purpose flour, a large bag of sugar, and three bags of chocolate chips. It was a long day. The cashier had seen you come in a few times — this time, she reminds you that they were closing soon. You know this, you promise her, this was the last time she’d see you today. She presses her lips like a fish to the side, and hands you your fourth receipt.</p>

                <p>You thank her. There was enough to last you all night, and you remember thinking that if you got the recipe wrong again, you’d wait until they reopened at 4. The drive home was fast, hazy. It had been hard to see past the dusty smudges on your glasses, but you were in a rush. You had to finish them so you could bring them to him tomorrow to apologize, bright and early, as soon as you could manage. Too much bitterness was your problem, and you knew he didn’t like it, and sometimes you got too bitter. And, last week, you’d gotten way too bitter and he left. You toss your keys into their basket and hurry back into the kitchen.</p>

                <p>He was going to wonder why they weren’t sweet enough, why you hadn’t made them sweet. You knew he had a real sweet tooth. Slowly, you pour the flour into the big bowl, already covered inside with residue from the last few batches. You dump in the baking soda, getting more dust on the countertop as you turned around, spinning the whisk. You’d foregone a recipe after you cussed out your computer this morning. Maybe you could add the cocoa powder and salt, and it would all taste the same then. Yes, that would work.</p>

                <p>You grab the salt cylinder, pop the nozzle, and pour it in. Salty, like you. After that, you grab the bag of cocoa powder and hold it with one hand as the brown dust falls into the bowl. Cocoa was sweet, right? It wasn’t enough right now, no of course not, but that was a good first step. </p>

                <p>One of your dust-caked hands raises to your forehead, instinctual. Your forehead was a little hot. Perhaps you’d been feverishly obsessing over this, over baking these — what are you even baking? Cookies? Cupcakes? How about cupcakes, Leo liked cupcakes.</p>

                <p>Oh, God, darling Leo. </p>

                <p>You shake your head, trying to clear it but only throwing more of the dust around the kitchen. Don’t focus on him just yet! You had to get the other things ready. The not-so-sweet things. It’s like you, you think, as you fully smash the first egg into the sink’s side. Son of a bitch. Shards of shell were everywhere. You were making even more of a mess. Carefully, you crack the egg onto the side of the sink, and empty the liquids into the bowl. You whisk in the milk, beating the yolk into nothing but a pastel pulp. You remember thinking this would taste so bitter and bland without the sugar. It’s like you. </p>

                <p> Leo would have said it was good enough, though. You mix, and the liquids slosh together into light yellow, dull and bland. He would have said something stupid and nice, like how you can’t make cupcakes without the egg. You probably could. They’d be so sweet. The cupcakes you’re making aren’t good, but he would have said they were good. But it wasn’t good. You knew he would have just said that because he was sweet.</p>

                <p>You dip your whisk into the cocoa powder dry mix, and lift it to taste. Your suspicions were too right. It had so much salt in it. Mixing in the eggs and the milk would only make this worse, worse. It’s like you, only worse.</p>

                <p>Ah, but you hadn’t added the sugar or the chocolate chips yet, all wasn’t just lost. And the butter! You weren’t done! There was still a chance!</p>

                <p>The box of chocolate chips knock over when you tried to grab it, and you swear as a few pieces fall off the counter, on top of the tiny mounds of forgotten dust from earlier in the day. Maybe the past week? You were going to get ants soon. </p>

                <p>Good thing Leo wasn’t here to see this. You were going to bring him the cupcakes and you would say “I’m sorry” and he’d say “Thank you” and hold your hand again and forgive you and tell you you’re wonderful and that he loved you and that it didn’t matter what his dad or his mom said and that you would run away together, you could, should run. </p>

                <p>He would eat a cupcake and say they’re great. His arms would wrap around your waist while you tried to mix this stupid dusty powder, and call it stupid with you. Maybe he’d say he loved you.</p>

                <p>The bowl clatters to the floor, so lost in your thoughts that your sweaty hands slide right off the sides. You’re yanked into reality, and he disappears, and the powder plumes around you in a hazy dream.</p>

                <p>You fall to the ground. Hands waving around the dust, coughing, dust in your throat. You couldn’t stop, this couldn’t happen, you need to finish these cupcakes so you can make something sweet for him, please, it has to be sweet for him. He loved sweet things and if you couldn’t make the cupcakes sweet, who knew what would happen. Maybe he’d even leave. Maybe he’d left. Maybe he’d left because you and the cupcakes weren’t sweet, because every idea you had to apologize came out half-baked, and now you were alone and bitter because you weren’t sweet enough. </p>

                <p>How long had you been doing this? Trying to make him apology cupcakes as though that could fix the ties you’d forced cut when you got mad at him. If you could only bake cupcakes sweet enough, then maybe he wouldn’t have sprinted out, left from the car that you’d been sitting in together. You knew that wasn’t true, and you weren’t even sure if what you’d said that night was right, but the dust was clouding your mind. </p>

                <p>You knew you had to try again. Just had to remake the sweet batter dust. More cocoa powder this time. More sugar, more chocolate chips. Sweeter. </p>

                <p>But by God you were so tired. You just slump back down into the mess, dust settling around you, on top of you. You remember thinking that you’ll just take a nap right there in the forgotten mess. It was where you belonged.</p>

                <p>You weren’t sure what happened after that. The more you thought back, the less you remembered, until all you could remember was the taste of too much sugar lingering on your dry lips.</p>

                <p class="subhead">Spice</p>

                <p> Leo starred not at the door, but the bell above it. It rang when the door opened and staring at the glass door would make him too anxious to see who was entering. It’d been a few days — a week? He couldn’t tell — since the break up — it felt like so, so much longer — and he had not come into the cafe — was it a break up, they hadn’t actually decided anything. It was unrealistic to expect Sebastian to walk into the cafe at that very second, at every second. They had stopped stocking the banana bread cupcakes, and those were his favorite anyway, why should he show up. </p>

                <p>When a relationship was going well, one typically wants their lover to meet their parents, and Leo’s family thrived on tradition. He had coaxed him into this. It was Leo’s fault. He’d wanted his boyfriend to meet his parents.</p>

                <p><i>“What made you, you know. How you are? How are you sure?”</i></p>
                
                <p>He blinked at the countertop. Today was a slow day at the cafe and he should spend some of his open time cleaning the blender or the cups. His coworker — today it was Melanie, tomorrow it will be Bryan, Sunday it will be no one because you don’t work Sundays — patted his shoulder sympathetically. She said something about how he didn’t need to worry. He didn’t fully register why he was grateful, but he thanked her anyway. He didn’t like not doing anything. His hands should be full of cups and water and the sponge and other hands, calloused from cutting wood and sanding. His hands should be full of Sebastian’s hands.</p>

                <p>He pulled away, eyes set on the cash register. 123, 456, 789. 0. Enter. Clear. Clear. Empty.</p>

                <p>He was mind was running. Heaving, tired and breathless.</p>

                <p>His friends, the few that knew about this side of him, all supported the break up, but he couldn’t tell if it was because they supported him on principle or if they truly didn’t like Sebastian. They said it’d be better after a few days. But it’d been a few days, many few days. If anything, it felt worse. </p>
                
                <p>Perhaps it was the situation. Leo began to deconstruct it again in his mind, like rewinding the security cassette tapes after a crime. His family was the kind to hate the sin and love the sinner.</p>

                <p>It was a Friday night. Leo drove him and Sebastian to his parents house. It was where Leo had moved in middle school, and the lawn was just as green, though the house’s paint was chipping, and Leo pointed out a faded yellow spot that marked where he hit the house with a paintball.</p>

                <p>They hadn’t said they were dating when his mother opened the door. Leo wanted to say. That was the plan. They were scary, it was scary, but he had to. He wanted his family in his life. Sebastian did, too. They were both afraid. Too afraid to even go to Pride or anything. They could figure things out in the tumultuous tangle of blankets and hand-holding and baking and kissing and love, oh love. Neither of them were out, not publicly, only to some safe people, people they could trust. His parents weren’t supposed to know yet.</p>
    
                <p>He didn’t know how they knew about Sebastian.</p>

                <p>Leo still remembered how his hairs stood up on the back of his neck when they walked into the house. They were celebrating the end of exams. It was winter break. He had to work, so he couldn’t stay home — his parents wanted him to stay, they told him many times that night — he had to work to pay rent and his job was near school — Sebastian would have missed him. Sebastian came because his parents invited his roommate, and that was Sebastian, and Sebastian didn’t want him to go alone either.</p>

                <p>It was a three hour drive to his home. They’d sung loudly, talked quietly, kissed at the red lights. Sebastian had made a playlist for the trip.</p>

                <p>“Are you okay?”</p>

                <p>Leo jumped at the intrusion, his family and that dinner drawing away in a puff. Someone was standing in front of him — they were a new regular and he didn’t know their name yet — tapping their credit card on the countertop — it was annoying, a dinging, a click or a clack too much — and watching with their eyebrows pinched. Something sat in their eyes, as they looked at him, something that made Leo want to carve a hole into his own chest.</p>

                <p>“I just, er….said hi.”</p>

                <p>“Hey,” Leo tried to throw on his customer service grin, “What can I get you?”</p>

                <p>“Pumpkin spice latte, please. Large,” he must have failed, because that thing in the customer’s eyes only deepened. Was it sorrow? Scrutiny? It was heavy.</p>

                <p>“Alright. Comin’ right up,” Leo looked back down at the screen, lifting a trembling hand to punch in the order, “Sorry, it’s….it’s been a long week.”</p>

                <p>“I feel that. It’s almost Christmas, ain’t it?” God, Leo couldn’t handle conversation right now. His voice rose an octave when he spoke, growing more and more distant with the sound.</p>

                <p>“Mm. I, uh, yeah. It is.”</p>

                <p>They didn’t respond now, but the weight in the depths of their irises increased. Leo didn’t know why it hurt. He couldn’t look them in the face, opting to smile at the top of their hat. It felt like they were all staring at him.</p>

                <p>He handed them their receipt and dashed to make the drink, ignoring the tingle on the back of his neck. They didn’t seem to mind, they’d went for a seat. Leo didn’t see where. It took a little bit for the espresso machine to warm up, but once it did, it was easy to make the latte.</p>

                <p>It was like clockwork. </p>

                <p>The clock was ticking when his mother asked why he was hanging out with “those kind.” When she derode Sebastian’s existence at the dinner table. Ticking for an hour, over an hour, two hours, going on three — questions about why he was roommates with a gay, how he should move out, how Sebastian could get help, why hadn’t he gotten help — oh but they knew someone who could help.</p>

                <p>Leo pressed the ground beans harder, faster, and twisted the portafilter into position, twisting the front door handle open as his mother screamed after him to fear Hell and pray for Sebastian. Hard loving hands pushed from behind him —he wasn’t there but he still had to catch himself on the counter as he stumbled over his own feet — as though he were there, as though he were running with Sebastian. Running away. They ran one block to the car and fled.</p>

                <p>They drove for an hour in silence. Leo thought Sebastian hated his parents. It was fair, he’d thought. He didn’t expect the homophobia to, ah. Jump out. He’d have to talk to his parents. Or maybe he didn’t. He had to figure something out. Leo and Sebastian could talk it out, discuss what to do, when they were home and safe and not boiled over angry. He hadn’t expected Sebastian to be mad at him.</p>

                <p>It wasn’t like he was wrong, either.  He was so upset, Sebastian’s bitter anger, biting words, scowls. So was Leo. And Leo did this to him, Leo did pull him into the middle of this situation, Leo made him face that kind of…. But he couldn’t take the claustrophobia from being surrounded by all the debris of what had just happened. He needed to think. </p>

                <p>Leo opened the door at a red light, the roads around him silent and empty, and he ran again.</p>

                <p>Sebastian had shouted after him, but he kept running away. He ran all the way to a mall before he called an Uber to take him to a friend’s apartment. </p>

                <p>His hands were shaking as he poured in the cream, so he didn’t make a design. This customer was a regular — Leo had seen him come in on Wednesday, Tuesday, and last Friday — he’d complemented the leaf Leo made last time — would he be disappointed — it didn’t matter. Melanie offered to help but Leo didn’t hear her over the nothingness in his head. He just wanted this customer to leave. Leave him back to his thoughts. Just run away to somewhere where he wouldn’t get hurt. </p>

                <p>“Pumpkin spice latte!” Leo set the cup down at the pick up station, in front of the customer.</p>

                <p>As his eyes trailed up, he caught a small glimpse at the other person’s eyes. The weight pooled in their eyes again, and it must have sunk further down their face, because it was tugging down the sides of their frowning smile. Held Leo down for eyes rapt under the light, judges asking if he were willing to burn — are you a baby? — you know you’re a sinner — why didn’t you call him, why didn’t you go after him, you useless idiot.</p>

                <p>He was running through the front doorway, through the car door, down the street and away. He didn’t want to keep running. He wanted to stay, make someone else run, have Sebastian run into the cafe and open the door and make that stupid bell jingle and apologize so Leo could apologize too and they could bring things back to how they were when no one was running and things were soft and slow and loved.</p>

                <p>“Thanks. I hope you have a warm holidays.”</p>

                <p class="subhead">Everything Else</p>

                <p>You really wish you knew how to bake. You were a good cook, you cooked dinner every night when you were together, but goddamn if you could only throw some yeast and shit together to put in the oven then things might have been different. You wouldn’t be cutting flowers now, no, you’d have a set of freshly baked cupcakes. But you can’t bake so you’re going to settle on giving him a bouquet.</p>

                <p>It’d been two weeks since you saw Leo and honestly you don’t know if you wanted to see him again. You knew you were right. You still had to apologize probably, but….you could just ignore him. Sure, you felt like there was a hole in your soul, but who’s to say you weren’t born empty? </p>

                <p>You chuckle at yourself, despite not knowing where the joke was. Your thoughts had gotten just a little too dark for your therapist’s liking, especially after the break up. She said you had to think of yourself using more positive words. What made you feel empty? But you weren’t sure what the answer to that was, because every time you thought back to that night your blood boiled.</p>

                <p>Learn to check yourself, your therapist had said. She taught you a breathing technique to do when you got angry. But, still, you weren’t in the wrong that night. You can’t have been in the wrong, Leo let his parents walk all over you. But it was wrong of you to take it out on him and yell at him and act like a brat and make him feel unsafe and you were in the wrong because you’d hurt him.</p>

                <p>You lift one of your geraniums and inspect its petals before snipping off the stem. Your hands shake a little too hard to make a perfectly clean cut, though it did go through. Eventually. You’ll just have to clean up the snips afterwards. It was okay.</p>

                <p>Maybe Leo just felt obligated to talk with you, to end things in a more civil manner than him unlocking the car door and physically walking away. Maybe it was your fault for not following him and making sure he was safe.

                <p>“I’m sorry,” your voice grumbles at the flowers as you make another abysmal cut.</p>

                <p>Your voice sounds as hollow as you feel. You take a breath through your nose, counting in your mind to four, then holding until seven as you arrange the flowers in perfect lines on the kitchen table.</p>

                <p>God, remember how messy the kitchen was last week? Blake came in clutch with helping you clean. And the way they rallied your other friends…. You should do something to thank them. They heard about the break up and came to check on you, basically forced you into the shower and into your bed as soon as you opened the door.</p>

                <p>You don’t know what you would have done had Blake not shown up. It was probably….you think for a bit. Yeah, that’d be considered a relapse. Blake probably knew, too. That’s why they’d driven you to your therapist’s office for an emergency appointment. Blake and their partner slept over, watching you like parents, almost. More loving. You loved them a lot. It was like finding a family rather than being disappointed and despised by the ones you had. Like Leo’s.</p>

                <p>You exhale slowly for eight seconds and grab all the flower stems with one hand. With the other, you set down a loose teal ribbon that you’d torn from an old Tiffany and Co. bag, and then you tie all the flowers together.</p>

                <p>One of the ribbon’s tails comes loose. You retie it. It’s okay. You tie it right on the second chance. It’s tight.</p>

                <p>Alright. That’s done. You grab the water-filled vase and gently sink in the geranium-orchid bouquet. He said you could meet him at the cafe at 4. That made sense, Blake worked there too, and it was a place where Leo felt safe. One month wasn’t enough to fix every issue, fill every crack, but it was enough to know where to start. And you weren’t the kind of person to not apologize for being a bitch. And you had been such a bitch. </p>

                <p>Now that the flowers were dealt with, you could focus on cooking. He did have a sweet tooth, after all, and he adored your teriyaki sauce. You open the fridge and take out the tofu you’d been marinating — you were going to put the diced tofu over some fried rice and mix it all up, because that's how you make good fried rice. It was okay. You could cook! You were just bad at baking.</p>

                <p>It was okay. Your hands shake only a little as you take out the carrot slices and dice them. They turn out square. You begin the breathing technique again.</p>

                <p>Maybe he’d even be proud of you for trying to fix yourself. But you shouldn’t flatter yourself, everyone’s constantly fixing themselves. This wasn’t anything special. And you were doing it for yourself just as much as you were doing it for him. You wanted to be someone he could love, someone he could feel safe with, and throwing eggs and flour around in the hopes of making something he’d like wasn’t the answer. You had to become someone he’d like.</p>

                <p>At least, that’s what you told yourself. Your therapist said you had to become someone you’d like, but in all honesty, you didn’t feel like that could ever be possible. Whenever you thought of yourself, it was just….negativity. Or nothing. </p>

                <p>Now, don’t think like that. Come on, your therapist’d be mad if she heard you saying that to yourself.</p>

                <p>“You’re doing a good job frying this rice, Sebastian.” Your voice sounds mocking, even to your ears and you wince.</p>

                <p>Idiot, you were supposed to be making yourself feel better.</p>

                <p>Just breathe. It’s okay.</p>

                <p>You cook the rest of the rice and tofu in silence, stirring with your wooden spoon, pouring in some soy sauce, some soup base, grating in some ginger. Dumping in the carrots and green onion.</p>

                <p>In, in, in, in. You just keep breathing in silence. </p>

                <p>It was going to be okay. You turn off the stove, done, and slide the fried rice into a glass tupperware container. Alright, done.</p>

                <p>Hold. Hold, hold hold holdholdhold.</p>

                <p>You look at the time on your phone and it’s 3:18. A little early. You exhale, exhale, exhale, exhale exhale exhaleexhaleexhale, and lift your glasses to the top of your head. You lean into your own hand, rub the bridge of your nose. The breathing exercise doesn’t clear your mind like your therapist promised it would — it actually makes your thoughts more disjointed, discombobulated, like dust floating around then sinking into piles.</p>

                <p>It’s easier to just not think. You close the container and wrap it as carefully as you can manage in a handkerchief. You stare at it. Something feels off. Just a little to the left, more than normal, but you can’t place it. It’s an uncanny valley kind of feeling where your stomach is sinking into your stomach and your brain was hollow. You should probably get going.</p>

                <p>You pick up the package and the bouquet and slide both into a grocery bag. You’re on autopilot now, watching yourself move to grab your keys, grab the door handle, grab the car’s door handle, grab the wheel, the bell sounds, and suddenly you’re sitting yourself down at the cafe with the number “64” on the metal indicator.</p>

                <p>You blink — the only movement you’re fully conscious of since doing your breathing exercise— and when you open your eyes, there’s a latte in front of you. You try to form a thought but your mind continues to cloud. Slowly, you move your fingers, rolling them against the table’s metal top, then reach for the coffee mug. Your shaking hand stills a bit once you touch the warm ceramic, enough for you to lift the mug to your lips and drink. You should leave. Before he gets here. Because you, you are the coward.</p>

                <p>The bell jingles. You put the mug down faster than you picked it up, your heart pounding blood into your ears, eyes trailing up at the door. It’s him, wrapped in his comfort hoodie, unshaven, hair tousled as though he’d just rolled out of bed and was about to ask what was for breakfast.</p>

                <p>You shiver despite the cafe’s heating.</p>

                <p>“Fancy seeing you here,” the joke escapes your mouth and you bite the bottom lip in guilt.</p>

                <p>He smiles a tiny bit at you. He sits across, eyes trained not on your face or your eyes but on the coffee you’d ordered earlier. “Hey,” his voice is as soft as the jingling bell above the door. You don’t know him anymore.</p>

                <p>“Hi, I’m,” you don’t know what to say. “I’m sorry.”</p>

                <p>He doesn’t look at you still. “You shouldn’t be,” his voice is soft and you have to stop yourself from wincing at how defeated he sounds. “I’m the….I’m sorry.”</p>

                <p>Neither of you seem to know where to start, since he’s just looking at your drink and you’re staring at his hair, and your thoughts drift to how greasy he looks despite you knowing he can’t have been as panicked  as you were. Or maybe he was and maybe you’re overestimating him, because you know he’s just as empathetic as you and the last time you saw him, walking away from your car in the night, he had tears in his eyes. </p>

                <p>Your eyes drift down. You can’t look. Because if you look, you’ll see that he has tears in his eyes now, too, and you don’t want to process that.</p>

                <p>Maybe this was a mistake. Trying to settle this and pulling him out here to talk. You can’t even form a sentence. Couldn’t even think in formed sentences. You try to think, but your mind’s still hidden behind a cloud of dustiness and worry, and nothing comes up, not a single thought.</p>

                <p>“It’s been….emptier. Without you,” you look up  to find Leo also staring at the table, face slack. “I’m sorry, too.”</p>

                <p>Your mind seems to finally click itself together. It’s in this haze that you consider that, maybe, in the slimmest of chances.</p>

                <p>“We’ll be okay,” you find the words slipping from your mouth faster than you can push them back, “I know I fucked up, and it’s valid if you don’t want to try again. I’m really….really sorry. For how I was acting. I was a bitch and I didn’t consider how you might feel. Like, they’re your parents.”</p>

                <p>He’s staring at you now, unblinking. His eyes are so beautiful, like chocolates. You take a slow, deep breath. Maybe that’s what your therapist was talking about. It seems to blow away some of the dust and you know itll be okay. “But….maybe it’s going to be okay. And we can-we can figure out what we want to do for now. But I’m sorry, and you said you’re sorry, and we can….it’s going to be okay.”</p>

                <p>You feel like you just ran across the whole continent, with the way your chest is constricting from those words and how they blew away all the dust, but the tiny smile he’s giving you is worth it. It’s okay. Maybe you’re sweet enough together. And you keep up your steely small smile, because he’s sweet as cocoa powder, and you’re bitter as milk. Maybe you’re going to be okay together.</p>
