            <div class="story-title">there was a little playground behind the school where you told me to meet you, but once i got there you werent anywhere in sight. i dont know if you just decided to not show or if you were there earlier and left but either way i spent the night with just myself and the starry reflections of my past lives. they called me a fool for listening to you but thats besides the point mostly they just wanted to know if you and i were still together. not in a dating sense more like if we were still the same person because the more i looked at them the more they saw that i was growing fainter so they came closer so i got fainter so they came closer so i nearly disappeared. they said i had to catch you. but isnt it in fairytales you who usually catches me? i dont know. i hate always being behind you with your foot on my leg and always blocking people from seeing me. maybe im better off without you, maybe this is how i was always meant to be seen. maybe youre the shadow and im the reality of thoughts minds personalities dreams and embodiments.  maybe  youre even less real than i am.</div>
